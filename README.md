# maths-notes
This is a repository for the course notes on mathematics that I had decided to build up. The basis for the notes are in-class teaching instructions, but the note packages themselves are more theorem-lemma-proof style, with figures and examples that I will hopefully flesh out as time goes on.

There are currently two note packages that are being actively maintained:

- MATH 325: Honours ODEs; an introductory course at honours level in the subject of ordinary differential equations; **30-May-2022 update: (partly) combined in another document, which will be uploaded soon**
- MATH 249: Honours Complex Variables; an introductory course at honours level in complex analysis **update halted**.

Both note-packages are editted on `LaTeX`, with the source code also provided herein. Updates will be every Sunday, with the new content of each week being incorporated in the note-package (my goal, anyways).
