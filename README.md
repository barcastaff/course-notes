# maths-notes
This is a repository for the course notes on mathematics that I had decided to build up. The basis for the notes are in-class teaching instructions, but the note packages themselves are more theorem-lemma-proof style, with figures and examples that I will hopefully flesh out as time goes on.

There are currently two note packages that are being actively maintained:

- MATH 249: Honours Complex Variables; an introductory course at honours level in complex analysis.
- A general concept document that agglomerates several courses across disciplines.
